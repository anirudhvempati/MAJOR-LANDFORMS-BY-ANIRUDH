    <h2 id="rabbits-info-heading">MOUNTAINS</h2>
<audio src="file:///A-Kiss-For-Amanda-DJ-Williams.opus"controls autoplay loop></audio>
    
    <br><p>A mountain is a landform which rises more than 900 meters about the mean sea level. Mountains cover 20 percent of the total land area of the earth. Mountains differ in Hight and shape. They have very steep slopes. The highest point of a mountain is called a peak or summit. Mountain peaks are conical in shape. Which is the highest peak in the world?</br>
<br>The Hight and shape of the mountain depend on their age. The Himalayas and Alps are young mountains. They are high and have conical peaks. The Aravallis and Appalachians are very old mountains. Therefore they are old and have round peaks. Several mountains may join together to form a range. Mountains often have parallel ranges, which may extend for hundreds of kilometres. The Andes in south America and Rockies in north America are two examples.   
</br><p>
<H2>IMPORTANCE OF MOUNTAINS</h2>
    
    <p id="cat">MOUNTAINS HAVE THIN SOIL COVER AND STEEP SLOPES. IT IS DIFFICULT TO GROW CROPS HERE THE MOUNTAINOUS REGIONS ARE THINLY POPULATED. THIS DUE TO UNSUITABLE CLIMATE, SHORTAGE OF FLAT LAND AND DIFFICULTY IN TRANSPORATATION. DESPITE THIS, MOUNTAINS ARE VERY USEFUL TO US.
</p>
<UL>
<LI>MOUNTAINS ACT AS A BARRIER AGAINST COLD AND HOT WINDS.</LI>
<LI><BR>RIVERS ORIGINATING FROM MOUNTAINS PROVIDE WATER FOR IRRIGATION.</bR></LI>
<LI>THE SLOPES OF MOUNTAINS HAVE RICH PASTURE LANDS AND VALUABLE FORESTS.</LI>
<LI>SOME MOUNTAINS ARE RICH IN MINERALS.</LI>
<h2 id="rabbits-info-heading">PLATEAUS</H2>

<p id="tac"><br>A plateau is a Highland with flat top it rises abruptly from the surrounding land so it has steep slopes. Many rivers and streams flow through plateaus.
</br></p>
<UL>
<LI>Some plateaus are very large an extend over hundreds of kilometers. The Deccan plateau in India is an example. The Tibetan plateau is the largest and highest in the world. It is surrounded by mountain ranges on all sides. Other examples are the Colorado plateau North America and the Bolivian plateau in South America.</LI>
<LI>Most plateau are in dry regions and on Leeward side of the mountains.</LI>
<LI>Plateaus have deep canyons on the surface. The Grand Canyon in The Colorado plateau is an example.</LI>
<H2>IMPORTANCE OF PLATEAUS</h2>
<LI>Plateaus have grasslands on which cattle and sheep are reared.</LI>
<BR><LI>Some plateaus are rich in mineral deposits.</LI></BR>

<H2>PLAINS</h2>

<p id="tac">A plane is a flat and low lying land surface. They are also called lowlands. They can be level or slightly hilly. The slope of the land is gentle.
</p>

<p id="tac">Planes may be formed by deposition of sand and silt by rivers, as in the case off the northern Plains of India. Rivers carry sand and silt with them. When the rivers slow down, these materials are deposited on their banks. Planes are formed by these deposits.</p>
<p id="tac">Some planes are in the interior of continents while some are near the Sea coast. Planes are more thickly populated than mountains and plateaus.</p>
    
<h2>IMPORTANCE OF PLAINS</h2>
<LI>planes have fertile soil which is suitable for agriculture. Most ancient civilizations Game up on the banks of rivers on the Plains.</LI>

<LI>Most big cities and towns are locator in the Plains.</LI>

<LI>It is easier to construct roads, railways, aerodromes and canals in the Plains.</LI>
<H2>DESERTS</h2>

Deserts are land areas that receive very little rainfall. these areas have a dry climate. Desserts have: -
<BR><LI>Very hot days and cold nights.</LI>
<LI>Frequent dust storms.</LI>
<LI>Hills of sand called sand dunes.</LI>
<LI>Little vegetation due to less rainfall.</LI></BR>
Most deserts are located on the western sides of continents and on Leeward side of
mountains. Some examples of deserts are the Sahara desert and the Kalahari desert in
Africa, the great Sandy desert and the great Victoria desert in Australia, the third desert and
the Arabian desert in Asia, the Atacama desert and the Patagonian desert in South America.
